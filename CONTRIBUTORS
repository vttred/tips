# People who have contributed patches show here.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people. For example, VTT Red employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Google holds the copyright.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file,
# either J's name or J's organization's name should be
# added to the AUTHORS file, depending on whether the
# individual or corporate CLA was used.
#
# Names should be added to this file as:
#     Name <email address>
#
# Please keep the list sorted.
