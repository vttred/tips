Foundry Tips is a FVTT module that displays random Foundry usage tips whenever
the user logs into a world. They can receive a core Foundry tip, a system-
specific tip, or a tip for another module!

## Installation

Foundry Tips is now available in the official Foundry VTT package list! Find
it in the package list, or follow these steps.

1. Copy the manifest URL: `https://github.com/vttred/tips/releases/latest/download/module.json`
2. Go to Foundry's Configuration and Setup > Add-on Modules, click Install Module.
3. Paste the manifest URL in the provided input box, and click Install.
 
## Developing Tips for your own Foundry package
 
Tips will automatically get loaded into Foundry Tips and a random tip for an enabled package
(or a core tip) will be shown to the user.
 
In your localization file, use the following structure.
 
```json
// example: modules/yourexactmodulename/lang/en.json
{
    //...
    "TIPS.yourexactmodulename" : {
        "0"         : "This is a tip.",
        "1"         : "This is the second tip.",
        //...
        "9999"      : "this is the last tip"
    }
    //...
}
```
 
No code! Just JSON! Please contact me if you use Foundry Tips and
need some help. Suggestions for restructuring the JSON are also
welcome at this time. Thank you!

**Foundry Fans! Tell the maintainers of your favorite systems and modules how you can help them write tips!**

## Contributing

You agree to license your contribution under the MIT Expat license. Your name and git.email
will be added to the [CONTRIBUTORS][18] file. Either you or your employer will be
added to the [AUTHORS][19] file. Please indicate if your contribution is part of your
employment (for copyright purposes).

### Contributing code

Fork this Repo! Clone your fork into a local directory. Create a branch
named after the improvement or fix you wish to solve, and append the issue
number. For example, `git checkout -b readme-improvements-9`. When you're done,
create a pull request to this repo with your completed change.

### Contributing tips in English

The easiest way you can contribute is just by answering Foundry Core
questions in the [Discussions][7] or in #core-how-to on the
[official Foundry VTT Discord server][8]. If you helped someone use
core Foundry from April 2021 onward, ask me for a contributor credit by
messaging me or opening a new Issue.

You can also contribute tips directly by opening Issues, replying to
Issues, and opening Pull Requests in this GitHub repository. You agree that
your tip contributions are [MIT][10] licensed.

**Note: A tip you've learned from someoneone else and written in your own words can be attributed to you as the author. A tip taken word-for-word from someone else can't be used without their permission. Facts are *libre,* writing is copyright protected.**

### Contributing tip translations

Each tip translation must match the key (the number before the tip
text) of the English tip. You may skip tip translations so long as
you also skip each number/key of the skipped tips.

VTT Red is in contact with a couple members of the Foundry community
to best serve their localization needs. Please contact corporat#1282
on Discord for further assistance.

### Contributing `dnd5e` and `worldbuilding` tips

Two packages, [`dnd5e`][12] and [`worldbuilding`][13] are maintained
by Foundry Gaming, and FG is not likely to maintain a tip repository
of their own. For these two packages only, we will accept contributions
into this repository. All other package tips should be contributed
to their respective package repositories.

## Changelog

See [Releases][9].

## License

Package code is available under the MIT Expat license. See [LICENSE][10].
Your obligation under the MIT Expat license is to credit the authors and
acknowledge their copyright.

A link to the tip on https://foundry.tips is sufficient in most cases (Coming soon!)
